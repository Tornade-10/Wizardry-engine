  The package gtest is compatible with built-in CMake targets:
  
      enable_testing()
      
      find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)
      target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main GTest::gmock GTest::gmock_main)
      
      add_test(AllTestsInMain main)
  
  sdl2 provides CMake targets:
  
      find_package(SDL2 CONFIG REQUIRED)
      target_link_libraries(main
          PRIVATE
          $<TARGET_NAME_IF_EXISTS:SDL2::SDL2main>
          $<IF:$<TARGET_EXISTS:SDL2::SDL2>,SDL2::SDL2,SDL2::SDL2-static>
      )
  
  imgui provides CMake targets:
  
    # this is heuristically generated, and may not be correct
    find_package(imgui CONFIG REQUIRED)
